# Red Team Notes

This repository contains structured notes focused on **offensive security concepts** from an attacker’s perspective.

The purpose of this repository is not to document tools or lab walkthroughs, but to capture **how and why attacks work** in real-world environments.

---

## 📌 Scope

The notes in this repository cover foundational and intermediate topics including:

- Networking concepts relevant to attackers
- Web application security fundamentals
- Windows and Linux internals
- Active Directory concepts and common attack paths
- Post-exploitation and attacker tradecraft

All content is derived from **lab-based learning and research**, rewritten to reflect practical attacker mindset rather than step-by-step instructions.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

Each note is written with the following structure:

1. What the concept is (brief)
2. Why it matters for attackers
3. How it is abused in real-world scenarios
4. High-level defensive considerations

This approach ensures clarity, relevance, and professional communication.

## ⚠️ Ethical Disclaimer

All content in this repository is created for **educational and defensive awareness purposes only**.

- No real client data is used
- No illegal activity is documented
- No live systems are targeted

All examples are based on controlled lab environments.
